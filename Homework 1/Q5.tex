\section*{Question 5}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Report the five number summaries of jumping distance.
	
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline 
		Min & 1st Quartile & Median & 3rd Quartile & Max \\ 
		\hline 
		13.71 & 15.35 & 16.43 & 17.62 & 18.17 \\ 
		\hline 
	\end{tabular} \vspace{1em}

	\item Please construct a scatter plot with a regression line.\\
	\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=4in]{Q5.png}\end{center}
	\item What are the covariance and correlation between "year" and "distance"?
	
	The covariance and correlation between the year and the distance are 48.477354 and 0.961747 respectively. Having a large positive covariance suggests that, as the years wear on, there is a demonstrable improvement in the distance that the jumpers can travel. Having a correlation that's very close to one suggests that time and distance, here, are tightly coupled. Note, though, that there's nothing to be said as to \emph{why} these two variables are correlated, and a strong numerical correlation is hardly enough to prove a causational relationship between the two.
