\section*{Exercise 10.20}

\begin{enumerate}[\quad(a)]
	\item Fit an LS straight line to these data. Plot the residuals against the speed.\\
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{Q51.png}$\qquad$\includegraphics[width=3in]{Q52.png}
	\end{center}
	\item Commend on the goodness of the fit based on the overall F-statistic and the residual plot. Which two assumptions of the linear regression model seem to be violated?

	While the F-statistic is very high (\texttt{58.76821}), the data appears to violate assumption one, that ``the mean of $Y_i$ is a linear function of $x_i$'', based on the two curves that seem to appear in the residual graph.
	\item What transformation of stopping distance should be used to linearize the relationship with respect to speed?

	Given what I know about the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity, the stopping distance should be square-rooted to create a linear relationship with the speed.
	\newpage
	\item Make this linearizing transformation and check the goodness of the fit. What is the predicted stopping distance according to this model if the car is travelling at 40 mph?\\
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{Q53.png}$\qquad$\includegraphics[width=3in]{Q54.png}
	\end{center}

	This linearized distribution has a better F-statistic, and an even lower p-value.

	Given how the data is taken using ten different cars, with different weights, internal components, and tires, even in potentially different road conditions, it seems foolish to use this data as the basis for any expectation on how long it should take some arbitrary car to stop. 

	However, the 95\% prediction interval for a car moving at 40 mph is $[93.1131, 96.3869]$ meters.
